# pattern creation C programming

## Description
This program creates 4 seperate text pattern on a seperate text file using C. The user is given a menu with 5 choices, 4 patterns and a quit option. Each option produces 
a seperate pattern. After the user chooses an option, the user is prompted to input an interger between 2 and 9 which will determine the size of the chosen pattern. When the user 
enters the number, the program will create a seperate text named "masoni_(pattern number).txt" and inform the user of the name of the file before terminating the program. 
If the user chooses pattern 3, the name of the text file will be "masoni_3.txt".

## Visuals
If the user inputs a pattern size of 5, here is what each pattern would look like.

```
pattern 1: 
5**** 
*5*** 
**5** 
***5* 
****5 


Pattern 2: 
****5 
***5* 
**5** 
*5***  
5**** 


pattern 3: 
***** 
****5 
***55
**555 
*5555 


pattern 4: 
***** 
5****
55*** 
555** 
5555* 
```
## Installation and compiling
The file will download in a .c file. It can be opened with notepad, notepad++ and other basic text editors. The program was written and compiled 
on replit's online C compiler, but it can be compiled and executed on any basic C compiler, including the command prompt.

## Controbutions 
The main function was provided to me by my class instructor and the rest of the code was completed by myself
